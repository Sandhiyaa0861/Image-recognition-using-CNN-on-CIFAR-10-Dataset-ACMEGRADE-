# Advanced CIFAR-10 Image Recognition with Transfer Learning

This project demonstrates an advanced image recognition model built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model leverages transfer learning with the VGG16 network, pre-trained on ImageNet, and fine-tunes the top layers for the CIFAR-10 dataset. It also includes data augmentation, learning rate scheduling, and useful callbacks like model checkpointing and early stopping.

## Introduction

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. This project aims to create a robust image classification model using transfer learning and advanced training techniques.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The dataset is divided into 10 classes:
1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

## Model Architecture

The model is built using the VGG16 network as the base model. The VGG16 network is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and used here for transfer learning. The base model's layers are mostly frozen, except the last 4 layers which are fine-tuned.

- *Base Model:* VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- *Additional Layers:* 
  - Flatten Layer
  - Dense Layer with 512 units and ReLU activation
  - Dropout Layer with 0.5 dropout rate
  - Dense Layer with 10 units and Softmax activation (output layer)

## Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is applied to the training data to improve generalization and robustness. The following augmentations are used:
- Rotation up to 20 degrees
- Horizontal and vertical shifts up to 20%
- Horizontal flip

## Training Strategy

The model training incorporates several advanced techniques:
- *Learning Rate Scheduler:* Adjusts the learning rate based on the epoch number.
- *Model Checkpoint:* Saves the best model during training.
- *Early Stopping:* Stops training if the validation accuracy does not improve for 10 consecutive epochs.

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
